# Buzzer Using Python Websockets

This project is a simple project to understand the workings of the WebSockets framework in python.

## Problem Statement

Assume there is a server with N number of clients connected to it. The server asks a question and the first client to respond to this question, by pressing the buzzer, wins. All the other clients that pressed the buzzer after the first get a response saying that they were x seconds late to press it.
